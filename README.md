# 🔱 Nmap-Pro V7: Ultrasonic Autonomous Edition 🔱
### Developed by: Vishal ❤️ Subhi
**Purpose:** Advanced Stealth Reconnaissance, Autonomous Vulnerability Mapping, and Exploit Discovery.

---

## 🚀 Overview
Nmap-Pro V7 is an "Ultrasonic" pentesting framework designed to operate autonomously. It combines the power of industry-standard tools (Nmap, Nuclei, Searchsploit, Nikto) into a single engine with a real-time "Matrix Green" web dashboard.

### 🛡️ Ultrasonic Features:
* **Self-Healing Setup:** Automatically detects and installs missing dependencies.
* **Ghost Stealth Mode:** Uses packet fragmentation and data padding to bypass AI-based Firewalls/IDS.
* **Exploit-DB Integration:** Automatically matches service versions with the local Searchsploit database.
* **Dual-View Dashboard:** Real-time logs on the left, Critical Vulnerabilities (Red Alerts) on the right.
* **Multi-Tool Fusion:** Orchestrates WhatWeb, Nmap, Nuclei, and Nikto in a single thread.
